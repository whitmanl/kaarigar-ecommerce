Dear Interviewer,

Due to time constraints, I spent some effort recovering my Phantom wallet and reviewing the bootstrap setup for the test. My preferred tech stack is Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, which required some time to familiarize myself with the provided codebase.

I implemented a reducer to manage the wallet state in the store. However, I would prefer using the Context API with custom hooks for a more streamlined approach.
